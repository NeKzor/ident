# ident

 An algorithm which tries to find the most optimal choices for [Tron: Identity].

## Caveats

* The algorithm cannot predict consequences of "worse" choices with a better outcome. For example: The conversation in
  `a1_s2_b_lobbyFirstHangoutPostGame` has two outcomes that have the same amount of keypresses in total. However, one is
  faster than the other which could only be [fixed manually].
* There is a [small bug] when calculating the best option for the last question in `a2_s4_b_lobbyGrishCheckInPostGame`.
* It currently takes about three minutes to run a full completion.

## Run locally

* Get [dotnet] SDK 7.0
* Get [AssetRipper] and extract `level1` file into the `data` folder
- Copy `Ink-Libraries.dll` from `identity_Data/Managed` into the `src/lib` folder
* Run with `./run.sh` or `.\run.ps1`

## Tool Assisted Speedrun (TAS)

The [TAS plugin](/tas/README.md) uses the route generated by the algorithm.
